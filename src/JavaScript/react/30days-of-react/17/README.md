# React Router
You may have not heard of the word route or router before and it might be necessary to define it here. The literal meaning of route is a path or a way to get to somewhere. The meaning in React is also similar to the literal meaning. React Router is by itself a React component which allows you to navigate between React components.

## BroswerRouter
BrowerRouter is a parent component which allows to wrap the application route. Using the BrowserRouter we can access the browser history. Sometimes it can renames as router.

## Route
The Route component allows to navigate between components. It is a pathway from one component to another. The Route component has two required props: the path and component or render.

## Nested Routing
We have implemented a simple navigation using React Router. Now, let's see how we can also nest a route. It possible to have a nested route in React.

## Redirect
Redirect can help us to redirect a route to a certain path based some condition. For instance if a user is logged in we redirect it to the dashboard otherwise to the login page. Let's implement a fake login in above snippet of code. If a user logged in it will redirected to the challenges otherwise we suggest the user to login.

## Error
Anytime your app throws an error while rendering, loading data, or performing data mutations, React Router will catch it and render an error screen. Let's make our own error page.
